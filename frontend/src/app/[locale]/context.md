# Locale Context

This directory is used for locale-specific resources or dynamic route folders (e.g., `[locale]`) in a Next.js app. It typically contains files or subfolders for handling internationalization, such as locale-based routing, translations, or middleware.

- **Purpose:** Organize code and resources by locale for i18n support
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use descriptive folder names for each locale (e.g., `en`, `vi`)
  - Store translation files or locale-specific components here
  - Keep locale logic modular and maintainable

Update this file as new locales are added or i18n logic changes.
