# Components Context

This directory contains reusable React components used throughout the frontend. Components are designed for modularity, UI consistency, and follow atomic/component-based design principles. Each component should be focused, typed with TypeScript, and documented for maintainability.

- **Purpose:** UI building blocks (buttons, forms, modals, etc.)
- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep components small and focused
  - Use TypeScript for props and state
  - Prefer composition over inheritance
  - Document props and usage with comments or Storybook

Update this file as new components are added or existing ones are refactored.
