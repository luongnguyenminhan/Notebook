# i18n Context

This directory contains internationalization (i18n) logic, configuration, and utilities for the frontend. It manages language switching, translation loading, and locale context for the app.

- **Purpose:** Centralize i18n logic and utilities
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use TypeScript for all utilities and config
  - Organize translation loading and language switching logic clearly
  - Keep locale resources and helpers modular

Update this file as i18n logic or supported languages evolve.
