# Lib Context

This directory contains shared frontend libraries, utilities, and helper functions. It is used for API clients, formatting utilities, and other cross-cutting concerns that are reused across components and pages.

- **Purpose:** Centralize reusable logic and utilities
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use TypeScript for all utilities
  - Keep functions focused and well-documented
  - Organize by feature or utility type for maintainability

Update this file as new utilities are added or existing ones are refactored.
