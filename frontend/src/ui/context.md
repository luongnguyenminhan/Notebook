# UI Context

This directory is intended for shared UI primitives or design system elements (if present). It may include foundational UI elements such as buttons, inputs, layout containers, or theme providers that are reused across multiple components and pages.

- **Purpose:** Foundational UI elements and design system primitives
- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep UI primitives generic and styleable
  - Use consistent naming and TypeScript types
  - Document intended usage and customization options

Update this file as new UI primitives are added or the design system evolves.
