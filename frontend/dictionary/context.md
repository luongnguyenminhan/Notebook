# Dictionary Context

This directory contains translation files for all supported locales. Each file (e.g., `en.json`, `es.json`) provides key-value pairs for UI text in a specific language. This structure supports scalable internationalization and easy addition of new languages.

- **Purpose:** Store translation resources for each supported locale
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use consistent key naming across all locale files
  - Keep translation files flat and organized
  - Add new locale files as needed for additional languages

Update this file as translations are added or updated.
